Another file to test "git pull" command…

So, overall notes on using git:

Create new repository on GitHub, get a unique url link for that repository
then in Terminal on my computer do:
git clone https://github.com/artsyanka/October2016Test1.git

Do
git status

it will copy directory(repository) and existing files onto my desktop.
Then, to add file do 
git add filename
then, 
do:

git commit -m "added Central Limit File —message“
- to commit file 

then do:
git push 
and .. voila … - your file was pushed onto github.

now.. 
if you or someone add new files directly on github, 
do
git pull 
- and those files will be added to your directory

IF sometimes you do commit without message:
git commit
then you get stuck in terminal
then need to do:
esc
:wq
